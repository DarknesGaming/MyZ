# MyZ

This is MyZ, a Minecraft plugin that allows you to re-live the game called DayZ (mostly). You are to explore whatever map the server owner has created and find loot to fight the infected population. Assemble teams or destroy the other humans, because survival is your ultimate goal with MyZ.

The current version of this plugin is v4.1-21256. It is NOT an official build, and the creator does not support this fork whatsoever. Unless you enjoy being electrocuted, sliced, chopped, or even erased from existence while in testing waters, please remember that these builds are NOT 100% tested. Many errors have been found and squished, however.

MyZ currently supports these versions: 1.7.9, 1.7.10, 1.8-1.8.8, 1.9-1.9.4, and 1.10-1.10.2. You can only get the full 1.8.X, 1.9.X, and 1.10.X support from this fork, as the official [GitHub](https://github.com/jordansicherman/myz/) and [Bukkit](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/myz/) pages for MyZ only support 1.7.9, 1.7.10 and 1.8-1.8.1.

This fork is focused on maintaining compatibility with later versions of Minecraft. Older versions of Minecraft (1.7.8 or below) will not gain compatibility with this plugin due to their age, and my inability to find older versions of CraftBukkit or Spigot. If you manage to add compatibility with older versions of Minecraft, you should make a pull request to me or the creator of MyZ. We will test it, and patch any errors if we find any that may cause HUGE problems.
